In this system we present a smart question paper generating system. 
It is a web application made to allow teachers to generate question 
papers with random but even questions to cover most chapters of subject 
with Blooms level within seconds even before few minutes of exam. 
In our system we allow administrator to input a set of questions w.r.t. 
topics. We also allow admin to provide weight age, matched COâ€™s and blooms 
levels complexity for each of these questions.											
After this the questions are stored in database along with their weight 
and difficulty level. Now on question paper generating time the admin just 
has to select the percentage of content from each topic. On this selection 
the system selects questions randomly in a way that their weightage makes 
up for total marks and according to difficulty that teacher chooses the 
questions are chosen based on their Blooms level. The questions are 
categorized according to various blooms levels so that as soon admin chooses 
no. of questions of each level (K1,K2,K3,K4,K5,K6) the system automatically 
generates paper in pdf format.
